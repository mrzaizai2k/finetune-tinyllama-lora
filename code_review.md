### 1. No GPU Availability Check
**Issue:** The original code assumes CUDA is available without verification, which will crash if running on a system without CUDA.

**Solution:** Implemented a `_get_device` method that automatically detects available hardware (CUDA, MPS for Apple Silicon, or CPU) and gracefully handles different hardware configurations.

### 2. No Model Loading Error Handling
**Issue:** The code lacks exception handling for model loading, which could fail due to missing files, network issues, or insufficient memory.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive try-except blocks around model loading and inference operations with proper logging to catch and handle errors gracefully.

### 3. Inefficient Batch Processing
**Issue:** The batch processing loops through each query sequentially, defeating the purpose of batch inference.

**Solution:** Implemented true batched inference that processes all inputs in a single forward pass, significantly improving throughput for multiple queries.

### 4. Lack of Resource Management
**Issue:** No explicit memory cleanup or model unloading, which can lead to memory leaks and OOM errors.

**Solution:** Added a `clear_cuda_cache` method and proper `__del__` implementation to clean up resources when done. Also included garbage collection to free memory.

### 5. Prompt Formatting Issues
**Issue:** Hard-coded prompt format that may not work for different model architectures.

**Solution:** Created a flexible `format_prompt` method that can be customized for different model families and made the formatting logic adaptable.

### 6. Fixed Generation Parameters
**Issue:** Hardcoded parameters with no customization options, making it impossible to tune generation for different use cases.

**Solution:** Made all generation parameters configurable with sensible defaults, allowing users to customize parameters like temperature, top_p, and max_length as needed.

### 7. Response Parsing Vulnerability
**Issue:** The output parsing assumes "Assistant:" appears only once and can break if it appears in the response content.

**Solution:** Implemented a more robust `extract_response` method that handles edge cases and has fallback mechanisms if the primary extraction method fails.

### 8. Missing Tokenizer Padding Configuration
**Issue:** The tokenizer's padding configuration is incomplete, which can cause issues during batch processing.

**Solution:** Properly configured padding tokens, ensuring the tokenizer has a valid pad_token (defaulting to eos_token if needed).

### 9. No Model Quantization
**Issue:** Using full precision model which consumes unnecessary memory, limiting the size of models that can be loaded.

**Solution:** Added support for 8-bit quantization to reduce memory usage by approximately 50-60% with minimal impact on quality.

### 10. No Input Validation or Safety Checks
**Issue:** Missing validation of user inputs, which could lead to undefined behavior or security issues.

**Solution:** Added input validation to check for invalid or empty inputs before processing.
